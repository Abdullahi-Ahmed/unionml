# Deployment Guide

`flytekit-learn` uses `flytekit` under the hood to execute your workflows locally, but you
can realize the true benefits of `flytekit-learn` by deploying your workflows to a production-grade
`flyte` cluster.

<!-- TODO: add few bullet points on benefits, with links to flyte docs -->

- {ref}`Flyte Sandbox Cluster<flyte_sandbox>`: To get a feel for how deployment works locally, first deploy your app workflows to a Flyte Sandbox, which you can learn more about [here](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/deployment/sandbox.html).
