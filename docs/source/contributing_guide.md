## Development Environment Setup

Create a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv ~/venvs/unionml
source activate ~/venvs/unionml/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### `pre-commit` Setup

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to ensure code standards. Follow the
[installation](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) instructions, then setup the `pre-commit` hooks:

```
pre-commit install
```

Make sure everything is working correctly by running:

```
pre-commit run --all
```

###  Run Unit Tests

Finally, to make sure your development environment is ready to go, run the unit tests:

```
pytest tests/unit
```

### Run Integration Tests [Optional]

Optionally, you can run integration tests locally. First install [flytectl](https://docs.flyte.org/projects/flytectl/en/latest/#installation), then:

```
python tests/integration
```
